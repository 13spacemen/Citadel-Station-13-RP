  - bugfix: "Null rods and equivalents now actually do the bonus damage they're intended to do against demonic creatures and aberrations."
  - rscadd: "Jagged spikes, which are good for jamming into people's ribs and then being guilty of a crime because that's assault with a deadly stick, are now printable from an autolathe. You can't keep your grip on them for long, though."
  - rscadd: "Disruptor blades, which are intended to deal bonus damage to animals and aberrations, are in the code, but unobtainable."
