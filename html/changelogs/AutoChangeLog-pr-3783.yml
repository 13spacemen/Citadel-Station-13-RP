  - code_imp: "Connected department jumpjeans to the role-restricted loadout tab. These can now be used.
tweak: Made it so that the feminine black jumpsuit is an actual jumpsuit, rather than jumpshorts.
tweak: Adjusted the sprite for the virgin killer sweater in ties. Sprite now fits on the body correctly.
tweak: Gave a large amount of what seem to be tg-ported pleated skirts sprite fixes/adjustments. You can now see your hands.
tweak: Fixed the Western Suit so that it can now be worn/seen. Yee-haw.
tweak: Cleaned up the arm sprites in r_human_vr that was giving human sprites the 'ass dot'."
  - spellcheck: "Corrected some descriptions/spacing that I found odd throughout the loadout pages I was working on. Definitely didn't find everything, but I got some of it."
